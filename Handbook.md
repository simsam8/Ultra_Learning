# Ultra Learning Principles

## Principle 1: Metalearning; Draw a map

- Learning about learning

### Short term map
- Do research to improve metalearning before and during a learning project

### Long term map
- Learning intuition built after several learning projects

### Determine Why, What, and How
- Why do you want to learn a skill?
- What knowledge and abilities to acquire. Break into concepts, facts and procedures
- How, resources, environments, and methods to use while learning

#### Why?

##### Instrumental Learning
- Learning to achieve a non learning result
- Acquire a new skill to stay relevant.
- Means to another outcome.
##### Intrinsic Learning
- Learning for the sake of learning
##### Expert Interview Method

#### What?
Write columns:
- Concepts
- Facts
- Procedures
##### Concepts
- Anything that needs to be understood
##### Facts 
- anything that needs to be memorized
##### Procedures
- Anything that needs to be practiced
##### Drawing the map
- Some topics require more effort in either of the three topics
#### How?
##### Benchmarking
- find the common ways in which people learn the subject or skill
- Course lists and syllabi for university courses
- Nonacademic or professional skill, online search for people who learnt it, or Expert Interview Method
##### Emphasize/Exclude Method
- Modify a default curriculum
- What is important/aligns with your goals?
- Omit/delay parts of curriculum that don't align with your goals.
##### How much research to do?
- Research enough to get started.
- Don't procrastinate by doing research.
##### The 10 Percent Rule
- Roughly 10 percent of learning time into research before starting.
- Decrease percentage when project scales
##### Avoiding Diminishing Returns
- Do more research when learning does not improve as much.
- Is there a better way to learn?
- Keep learning if doing more research is not making improvements.
